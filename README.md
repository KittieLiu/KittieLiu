🔎 You can find my projects here [portfolio] <br>
🔭 I'm currently on the job hunt to fund my My Melody collection!.<br>
🧸 Currently upskilling in Python, as it wasn't covered in my university curriculum.<br>
🎓 Graduated from Rajamangala University of Technology Rattanakosin (RMUTR) with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.<br>
👩‍💻 Internship in Year 3 : Sony Device Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd. Assistant Programmer position (😎Very proud, learned a lot, very lonely training alone🥺) Developed a maintenance system from the previous generation.**It was very difficult for students who were just in their third year and didn't know how to use different coding languages ​​together or what each language could do.😭 The first day of the internship was very stressful because students from other universities were already in their fourth year. But it was a very good memory🥰, I will never forget it. I gained more knowledge and understanding than when I was studying at university. <br>

🐢My journey to graduation wasn't typical: it took me eight years to complete my degree.

In my eighth and final year, I struggled internally with the immense pressure to complete the project. There were tears, stress, and moments of complete loneliness. My classmates had already graduated, and I had no one to rely on but myself.

However, I pushed through with determination and finally achieved it. This experience taught me a profound lesson: even if I was only moving forward by 1 percent each day, I would still be improving and eventually succeed. This mindset is now my guide. 🎉🥳
